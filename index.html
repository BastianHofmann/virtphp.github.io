                <h3>What Is VirtPHP?</h3>

                <p>VirtPHP is a tool for creating isolated PHP environments. Think <a href="http://virtualenv.org/">virtualenv</a> for PHP.</p>

                <p>Most people have systems with one PHP, one place to install PEAR packages, and one place to install PECL extensions, and those are the versions that must be used for all development on that system. That's not really ideal if you need to do development using various versions of PEAR packages or PECL extensions.</p>

                <p><em>VirtPHP to the rescue!</em></p>

                <p>VirtPHP creates isolated environments so that you may run any number of PHP development projects, all using different versions of PEAR packages and different PECL extensions. You may even specify a different version of PHP, if your system has various installations of PHP (i.e. you've built multiple versions for testing).</p>

                <h3>Is It Ready? Can I Use It?</h3>

                <p>No. It's not ready yet.</p>

                <p>We developed VirtPHP over the span of 48 hours at <a href="http://hacknashville.com/">Hack Nashville</a> on May 4-5, 2013. So, it's still very new. We haven't even dusted the wood shavings off or sanded down the rough edges yet.</p>

                <p>Before VirtPHP is ready to release to the wild and open for pull requests and your contributions, we have some clean-up work to do. So, be patient. You'll be able to try it out soon!</p>

                <h3>PHP Is For Web Development. How Will This Work With Web Servers?</h3>

                <p>We're still figuring that out. We'll probably need your help.</p>

                <h3>How Will It Be Licensed?</h3>

                <p>VirtPHP will be released under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.</p>

                <h3>Who's Responsible?</h3>

                <p>The team behind VirtPHP is Jordan Kasper (<a href="https://twitter.com/jakerella">@jakerella</a>), Ben Ramsey (<a href="https://twitter.com/ramsey">@ramsey</a>), and Jacques Woodcock (<a href="https://twitter.com/jacques_thekit">@jacques_thekit</a>).</p>
